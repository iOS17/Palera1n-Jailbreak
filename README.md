## Introduction


### Brief overview of the Palera1n Jailbreak tool.
Palera1n is a semi-untethered jailbreak for iOS 11-17.1 (theoretically 17.6.1) and iPadOS 17, 18, 18.1-18.5. Nick Chan, the lead developer, and the Palera1n team created the tool. The tool is based on the checkm8 exploit. This means that the tool is compatible with A11-A8 devices.  The Palera1n jailbreak enables users to customize their iOS devices by installing third-party apps and tweaks. 

After successfully jailbreaking your device, you can install modern package managers such as Sileo, Zebra, or Cydia.

### Purpose and benefits of using the tool.

Palera1n is a jailbreak tool for devices with A8-A11 (iPhone X) chips running iOS/iPadOS 15.0 and above (iPadOS 18.1). It's essential to understand the purposes, benefits, and potential risks before deciding to jailbreak your device.

**Purposes:**

**Customization:** Gain access to the root filesystem of your device, allowing you to install tweaks, themes, and apps not available through the official App Store. This can personalize your device's look and feel and add features Apple doesn't offer.
Advanced features: Unlock functionalities not present in the stock iOS, such as tethering your device to other devices without a carrier plan or recording system audio.

**Development and testing:** Developers can use jailbroken devices to test apps and tweaks before releasing them to the public.

**Benefits:**

**Increased functionality:** Access features and customizations beyond what Apple provides.
Greater control: Manage your device more freely and tailor it to your specific needs.
Explore the iOS ecosystem: Discover third-party apps and tweaks that Apple doesn't officially sanction.

**Features:**
Palera1n is a semi-untethered jailbreak tool that supports iOS/iPadOS 11 to 17.3 (with limitations). It's also important to remember that the tool is open-source, which means anyone can use it for educational purposes. Also, the Palera1n uses a bootrom exploit, making it difficult for Apple to patch. This means that upgrading to a newer version of iOS is pointless because this is a hardware bug that Apple cannot easily patch. 
Unlike other iOS 15 to iOS 17 jailbreak tools, palera1n jailbreak supports features like root access, tweak injection, and custom themes.

**How it works:**
Palera1n uses a vulnerability in the iBoot bootrom, a low-level program that runs before the operating system.
This allows Palera1n to inject code that grants root access and activates jailbreaking features.
The jailbreak is semi-tethered, which means it must be re-applied after restarting the device.

### iOS 17, iOS 17.1, 17.2 & iOS 17.6.1 Version Compatibility

Before you start the Palera1n installation process, it's essential to ensure that your device is compatible with the tool. We recommend using an AI-based jailbreak finder tool that can provide accurate, trusted, and up-to-date information regarding jailbreak compatibility for any iDevice, including iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS, and Apple Watch.

**Important notes:**

* Palera1n is a semi-tethered jailbreak, meaning you must re-jailbreak your device using a computer application after every reboot.
* Jailbreaking can be risky and may void your device's warranty. You can always back up your device before proceeding.
* Only use trusted sources for jailbreak tools and instructions.

**Additional information:**

* While Palera1n is compatible with iOS 17.6.1 to 18.1, it's still under development, and some issues are to be expected.
* The jailbreak community is working on a solution for iOS 18.1, but there's no estimated release date yet.
* You can find the latest updates and information about Palera1n on its official GitHub repository: [https://github.com/palera1n/palera1n](https://github.com/palera1n/palera1n)

## How To Install Guide

Palera1n is a work-in-progress jailbreak that is **compatible with A11 (iPhone X) and earlier devices running iOS 15.0 or later**, with some restrictions for A11 devices.

**On A11 devices, you must disable your passcode** and will be unable to use it or any other SEP functionality until you boot into a stock iOS environment. SEP functionality includes passcodes, Face ID/Touch ID, and Apple Pay.

Additionally, **if your device is an A11 device running iOS 16 and you've previously set a passcode, you'll need to erase all content and settings before jailbreaking**.

**If you're using an older, tethered version of palera1n**, you'll need to **uninstall it before proceeding**.

If you're using Windows, see Using [Palen1x instead](https://ios.cfw.guide/using-palen1x).

### Installing the jailbreak - Mac

### Troubleshooting tips for common installation issues.

**For Windows Users: **
If you are trying to use a Virtual Machine software of some sort from Windows (e.g., Virtualbox, VMWare, Windows Subsystem for Linux, etc) you will not succeed with following this guide, and will need to obtain a bootable medium and follow the steps below using that bootable medium.

If you are using a computer with an AMD Ryzen CPU, you will likely run into issues. If you do run into issues, you should use a Mac or a computer with an Intel CPU to follow this guide.

If you are using a USB-C to Lightning cable to do this process, you may run into issues entering DFU mode

If you do have issues, get a USB-A to Lightning cable and, if necessary, also get a USB-C to USB-A adapter.

A9(X) and earlier devices have an issue where they will get stuck midway through this process in pongoOS. To work around this issue, you'll need to do the following:

In the terminal window, press Control + C on your keyboard
Rerun the command that you just ran
You'll need to do this every time you re-jailbreak your device as well.
